# ezlang
ezlang is a python module that is supposed to make ML based NLP easy for non practitioners. 
The library is largely based on the sentence_transformers package for creating contextual embeddings(numerical representation) for sentences
these embeddings can then be used to accomplish two tasks, text clustering and classification via a very simple interface.
